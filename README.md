# ðŸ§  Manual Neural Network (Python + NumPy) 

## Overview
This project implements a basic **Neural Network from scratch** using only `NumPy`.  
It demonstrates how forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent work internally â€” without relying on machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features
- Manual forward and backward pass
- Sigmoid activation
- Mean Squared Error loss
- Two-layer architecture (input â†’ hidden â†’ output)
- Clean, simple, and modifiable structure

## How to Run
```bash
python manual_NN.py
```
Requirements
Python 3.x
matplotlip
NumPy
